        <h1>Preface</h1>
        <p>
            The last few years have seen a dramatic upsurge in research in end user programming.
            Much of this renewed interest is due to the popularity of the Web. 
            The Web browser is rapidly replacing the personal computer’s desktop as the platform for many computer activities, 
            and users can now find information, make purchases, and communicate with each other through a Web browser.
        </p>
        <h2>“End-User Programming on the Web” workshop at ACM SIGCHI</h2>
        <p>We began by organizing a workshop at the SIGCHI conference (ACM Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems) in April 2009. The goals of this workshop were three-fold: (1) to bring together researchers from a variety of institutions and establish a sense of community, (2) to discuss common problems and share lessons from our work, and (3) to plan the publication of an edited book on this topic. The goal of the book was to make it easy for researchers to read about the latest approaches and innovations in the field and to make this interesting topic more readily available to a larger audience.</p>
